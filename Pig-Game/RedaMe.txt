This is a JavaScript implementation of a simple dice game for two players. The game starts with both players having a score of 0. 
On each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they want, with each roll adding to their current score. 
If they roll a 1, their turn ends and their current score is reset to 0. The player can choose to hold their current score, which adds it to their overall score. 
The first player to reach a score of 20 or more wins the game. The game also includes buttons to start a new game and to hold the current score. 
The game tracks the current player, the current score, and the overall scores of both players. The HTML file includes a game board with two sections for the players, 
each displaying their current and overall scores, and buttons to roll the dice, hold the current score, and start a new game.
