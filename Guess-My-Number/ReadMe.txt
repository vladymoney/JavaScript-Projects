This is a simple guessing game built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game generates a random secret number between 1 and 20, 
and the player must guess the number by inputting their guess into a text field and clicking a "Check" button.The game keeps track of the player's score, 
which starts at 20 and is reduced by 1 each time the player makes an incorrect guess. If the player correctly guesses the secret number, 
the game displays a message indicating that they have won, and their current score becomes the new high score if it is higher than the previous high score.
If the player exhausts their 20 guesses without correctly guessing the secret number, the game ends and displays a message indicating that the player has lost.
The player can start a new game at any time by clicking an "Again" button, which resets the score to 20 and generates a new secret number.
